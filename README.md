# checkerboard_py
Passing data / Looping to render in html
- Note: This for some reason didnt pull the html file. I will get that uploaded shortly. 

# Objectives
Your program should have the following output:
- http://localhost:5000 - should display 8 by 8 checkerboard
- http://localhost:5000/4 - should display 8 by 4 checkerboard
- http://localhost:5000/(x)/(y) - should display x by y checkerboard.  

For example, http://localhost:5000/10/10 should display 10 by 10 checkerboard.  
Before you pass x or y to Jinja, please remember to convert it to integer first (so that you can use x or y in a for loop)
